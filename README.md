# Password Manager - React Native App

PasswordManager is a React Native mobile application designed to provide users with a secure way to store
and manage their credentials. With PasswordManager, users can securely store sensitive information such as
usernames, passwords, and other credentials, protected by robust encryption and security measures.

# Features

- Secure Storage: Utilizes industry-standard encryption techniques to securely store user credentials locally on the device.
- Password Generation: Provides users with the ability to generate strong, random passwords for their accounts.
- Biometric Authentication: Supports biometric authentication (fingerprint, face recognition) for added security.
- Custom Categories: Allows users to organize their credentials into custom categories for easy management.
- Sync Across Devices: Future roadmap includes the ability to securely sync credentials across multiple devices.

## Technologies Used

- React Native: Built using the popular framework for creating native applications using JavaScript and React.
- Redux: Utilized for state management, providing a predictable and centralized data store.
- AsyncStorage: For secure and persistent storage of user credentials on the device.
- React Navigation: Handles navigation within the app, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience.
- Crypto Libraries: Leveraged for encryption and decryption of sensitive data to maintain security.
